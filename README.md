Example of writing to a 3d texture in a compute shader and reading from fragment shader. The compute shader writes to a 128x128x128 texture the rgb corresponding to the coordinates and the fragment shader renders every XY layer and goes through the Z axis when time passes.

Clone the repo and open the .sln file and press the play button and I think it should work.
